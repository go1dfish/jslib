# What Is This?

`jslib` is my personal collection of general utility functions and 
code snippets that I find myself needing time and again. Feel free
to fork/copy/reuse in any way if you find stuff in here useful.

# Licensing?

Generally, most code in this repository is dual-license [WTFPL][]
and (MIT)[]; there are a few exceptions which are [MIT][] only,
as they are derived from third-party sources. If you care about
the difference, check individual file headers to make sure.

[WTFPL]: <./LICENSE.WTFPL.md>
[MIT]:   <./LICENSE.MIT.md>
